 Hey there! 👋 I'm **Bingxu An** (安炳旭), a first-year Master student in UCAS, Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, majoring in Artificial Intelligence. I received the B.S. degree from Huaqiao University(HQU) in July, 2025.

In HQU I joined the [SENDS](https://github.com/SendsTeam) Lab at HQU, where I met a group of incredible friends who share the same passion for technology and innovation. Now, my research passion lies in **LLM&Rec** (LLM/Recommendation Systems/LLM4Rec).
